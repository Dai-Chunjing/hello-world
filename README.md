# hello-world
This Repository is a public folder that is composed of un-categorized materials, and it does not contain any initial creation of mine.

I am Dai, a recent graduate from University.  Encourged by Xiaolai's New Book on Github, I decided to learn coding as I continue on reading this book. My educational background is on Business studies, which have nothing to do with computer science and codes.  But I am willing to put efforts and have a try!

This Repositary is the first one I have built on Github.  It is planned to be a folder where I would practise the codes I am learning.  For this reason, it would not contained any initial creation codes of mine. (I may write plenty of comments, though.)
This Repositary is Licensed under GNU GPLv3.  Any user is welcomed to edit the contents and commit changes under separated branches. The only thing they cannot do is to close the repositary itself. (That is my understanding of this license)
